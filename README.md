## Overview

This project serves as a foundation for building decentralized applications (DApps) on the NEAR Protocol using React and near-api-js. It includes a simple initialization setup and a basic structure for integrating NEAR functionality into a React application.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation:** Clone this repository and run `yarn` to install the necessary dependencies.

2. **NEAR Initialization:** The NEAR initialization logic is encapsulated in the `init` module. Customize this module based on your specific requirements, ensuring proper configuration of the NEAR connection and wallet setup.

3. **App Component:** The main application logic is located in the `App` component. Customize this component to implement your DApp's functionality.

4. **Rendering:** The project uses React and `createRoot` for rendering. Adjust the rendering logic in `index.tsx` based on your project's needs.

5. **Run:** Start the application by running `yarn start`.
